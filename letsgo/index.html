                        <h2>Sketches and Ideas</h2>
                        <p>Let’s Go started as a mobile concept that was later brought to a tablet form. The sketching process helped us simplify the idea by removing features that were excessive. Large menus and complex input fields were replaced with a simplified navigation menu and easy tap interactions. The sketches process helped us ask important questions such the user's preferences  and the way couples connect their accounts. We then reconstructed the events page into a gallery so the user can view the information more efficiently.</p>

                        <h2>LoFi Design Mockups</h2>
                        <p>A LoFi mockup is crucial in order to transition to a final design prototype. The mockups gave us a better visual idea of how the users will navigate through the app. In addition, it helped us understand the different layouts and spacing for user interaction. Through this process we kept asking ourselves, “How we can improve on this design and make it more time efficient for the user?”. By adjusting minor designs conflicts and finalizing on the overall layout we then moved on to a higher design mockups.</p>

                        <h2>User Testing &amp; Final Design</h2>
                        <p>The usability testing was well received however, we learned that the were minor issues. We found that some users did not follow the onboarding screens and suggested to include a skip button to go directly to the main menu. Another useful comment came from a user who thought she was signing into a specific event rather than creating an account. We took note in that to display the information more clearly. In terms of iconography most users understood what each button meant, still there was room for refinement after one user was uncertain to what button to press. We then added the necessary changes and moved forward to the final design prototype.</p>
